<h1>AI Model Taxonomy Repository and Decentralized Model Forensics DAO</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The <strong>AI Model Taxonomy Repository</strong> is a neutral, encyclopedic catalog dedicated to documenting AI models with factual detail, technical specifications, historical context, and relevant references. The repository provides a transparent, blockchain-backed record for each model, emphasizing the long-term preservation and accessibility of AI information. Alongside the repository, the <strong>Decentralized Model Forensics DAO</strong> empowers a global community to oversee the integrity of the repository, allowing members to submit cases, vote on adjudications, and act as “keepers” of this record, ensuring each entry remains unbiased and accurate.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the repository houses a crowd-sourced, non-fungible glossary of critical terminology related to AI and security, such as “transparency,” “safety,” “risk,” and more. This glossary captures diverse perspectives on essential terms, allowing users to view and understand the evolving language and definitions that shape AI discourse.
</p>
